# Snake

This is an attempt to recreate the game snake on the terminal window.

The snake can be controlled by both the WASD keys and the arrow keys, and the size of the board can be changed by changing the parameters in the main() function being called.

Sadly, this only works on Windows as it relies on the msvcrt python module, which is windows-exclusive
